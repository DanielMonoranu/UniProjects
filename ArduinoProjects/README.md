# ARDUINO PROJECTS:


# ARDUINO_Begginer_Project
I made my first Arduino beginner project in my second year at UPT. 
I used everything I learned in my course about microcontrollers and made a program that uses interrupt routines programmed internally with registers: a led that flashes once a second, another led with a dimming effect obtained with PWM signal, and an additional Led that is on only at a specific temperature. The isolated functionalities were simple enough to make, but the integration of every module proved to be quite difficult to implement.

# PID_temperature_controller
The second project was made in my third year at university. This one is a PID controller that regulates the temperature using a light bulb and an LM35 sensor. I implemented a state machine pattern that has a state for every variable to be set: the timing for the 3 distinct processes: heating, maintaining of temperature, and cooling.
 
# SmartBarrier
This project contains the component for controlling the barrier for an automated system made for university with other colleagues. When a car approaches the barrier it needs to send a code from the designated app and if the code is correct the barrier will open.

# FloodAlert
This project contains a sensor for floods in a house and a webpage that shows the current temperature and alerts the user if there if the water level is too high.
